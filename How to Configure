1. I recommend firstly that you have a Proxy account created, this will need acecss to the Host, SQL and possibly the Netbackup appliance. Domain\svc_SQLNetbackup
The account will need logon as a service along with sysadmin to start, each domain may be different.
2. Create the backup policies you need on the Netbackup appliance console. 

Generally this may look like the below. (These are referenced in the package and can be selected from the SSIS envrionment variables you will also need to set up)

Domain_SQL_Database
Domain_SQL_TransactionLogs

3. Install the Netbackup Agent to the host and configure the following SQL server connection properties in the Netbackup agent
Host
Instance
UserId and Password
4. Ensure that the service account created in step one is the account that runs the following local services.
Netbackup Client Service
Netbackup legacy Network Service

5. Using the account you created in step one create a credential and Proxy on the SQL instance. Proxy rights below
Operating system (CmdExec)
SQL Server Intergration Services Package
Powershell

6. You will need SSDT and SSIS installed on the instance you wish to deploy this to. 
7. Within the package configure the settings as required. 
8. Once you have created the SSISDB, create the folder you will deploy to [SQLNetbackupV2] 
9. Deploy the packages
10. Configure the environmental variables, its good to name them after the backup policies. 
11. Create within each environmental variables the following.(This must be in the correct order as per below.

Domain_SQL_Database Envirionment 
VariableName = NBPolicy, Type = String, Value = -p Domain_SQL_Database -np
VariableName = NBServer, Type = String, Value = -p Host.FQDN
VariableName = SQLHOSTQualifier, Type = String, Value = .Domain.local

Domain_SQL_TransactionLogs Envirionment 
VariableName = NBPolicy, Type = String, Value = -p Domain_SQL_TransactionLogs -np
VariableName = NBServer, Type = String, Value = -p Host.FQDN
VariableName = SQLHOSTQualifier, Type = String, Value = .Domain.local

12. Create SQL jobs for the different packages you whish to use. Ensure that the owner is the service account you created. 
Full backup
Diff backup (Master DB cannot be selected in this job and must be excluded) 
TLog backup
Onetime Full Backup

When configureing the Job use the environmental variables. 

13. Ensure that the [SQLGuard_Ops] exists on the instance. 

Test and modify as you need, each domain is different and you will need to work with you storage / backup team to ensure that it works for what you need. 
Its quite useful and I hope it makes your life as a DBA easier. DB restors would continue to be actioned via the Netbackup agent, you will see the backups your sending list in one of the views.
